The One Health concept recognizes that health issues must be addressed cohesively instead of independently. This approach is essential considering approximately 70% of emerging infectious disease cases in humans and livestock are a consequence of spillover events from wildlife. Similarly, humans play a role in animal disease emergence by facilitating global transfer of infectious agents, altering landscape conditions, and creating environmental disturbances. Additionally, plant diseases can reduce global agricultural productivity by up to 40% for the five major food crops, undermining our ability to safeguard national and global food security.

These are difficult tasks, but necessary for businesses to maintain their competitive edge. Yet, few people really understand how to make this happen. That is where this course fits in. It is about understanding how and why some firms can maintain their entrepreneurial spirit, competitiveness, and growth, whereas others are not. It is about creating work environments where innovation is the norm, where employees are encouraged to work entrepreneurially, where leadership is supportive (not controlling), and where firms are organized to take advantage of all the good things that its people do. This course will be one of many questions, issues, examples, and controversies. Students will be expected to develop and defend their opinions, to independently search for what the  best companies  do, and to suggest how others can do better.

In this course we will investigate how energy is derived from all the available technologies: from coal to tidal. This will include the full aspect of energy consumption including infrastructure, mining, energy storage, energy delivery, and waste disposal. As we discuss various countries and how they derive their energy, we will see that the proportion and the total amount of energy generated by the various technologies differ dramatically.
